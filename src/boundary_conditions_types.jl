# geometry axis is captured here so "is this an overlapping coupling?" is a
# single `isa` on the abstract type rather than an enumeration of concretes that
# every call site must keep in sync (the omission of one concrete from such an
# enumeration is exactly what double-counted the overlap energy).  An overlapping
# coupling meshes a shared volume twice; a non-overlapping one partitions the
# domain across a measure-zero interface.

# Analytic level-set surface constraint for energetic mesh smoothing.  The nodes
# of a side set are held to a smooth boundary surface g(x) = 0 while sliding
# freely within it — an inclined roller.  The exact gradient ∇g is obtained
# automatically from the symbolic g via Symbolics.gradient, so the user supplies
# only g.  A node shared by two such side sets accumulates both constraints,
# realizing the edge (curve) case; three, a pinned vertex — the dimensional
# hierarchy falls out of side-set membership with no special case.
#
# Two enforcement modes share this type and its YAML (selected by `enforcement`):
#   :exact   — local-frame roller (the production mechanism).  The residual is
#              projected onto the tangent subspace (its normal component is the
#              constraint reaction) and, after each step, the node is
#              closest-point-projected back onto the surface.  Surface-exact up
#              to the return-to-surface tolerance; needs a matrix-free solver.
#   :penalty — a quadratic penalty P = ½ κ g² whose force κ g ∇g is added to the
#              internal force and whose Gauss–Newton Hessian κ ∇g ∇gᵀ is added to
#              the stiffness.  Approximate (residual ~ 1/κ) but works with the
#              Newton solver too; a derisking/validation tool.
